# Assignment 5: Restaurant Icons

# Each function will take the position it is located on the screen in addition to the size.  
# The position will be two different variables.  (X, Y, Size)
# The size of the icon will change based on the size variable
# The X and Y is the starting position of the turtle
# It should be oriented the same way each time it draws (HINT: setheading)
# Uses color
# Uses a loop within its drawing.  

# Design 1 Function
def design_1(x,y,size):
    x = 0
    y = 0
    size = 0
    return

# Design 2 Function
def design_2(x,y,size):
    pass

# Main Function
def main():
    design01 = design_1()
    design02 = design_2()
main()
