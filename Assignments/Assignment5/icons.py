#Here is what he needs:

# A function for each of the icons
# Each function will take the position it is located on the screen in addition to the size.  The position will be two different variables.  (X, Y, Size)
# The size of the icon will change based on the size variable
# The X and Y is the starting position of the turtle
# It should be oriented the same way each time it draws (HINT: setheading)
# Uses color
# Uses a loop within its drawing.  (HINT: A loop that always and only runs once is not a loop.)
